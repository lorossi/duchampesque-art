# Duchampesque art

## Or how I asked myself: If he could, why can't I?

## What are you onto?

Marcel Duchamp (1887-1968) was a French arist, mostly known for his fundamental contribute to the new *conceptual art*, whom he created. He was the leader of the *ready-made* art movement, where normal objects (ant not what before him was considered art) were taken out of their environment, modified and exposed in museums.

In my opinion that's a very controversial artistic style, because it's often seen as something *cheap* and not really interesting.

However, Duchamp is remembered as a very prolific artist. One of his most famous works is *L.H.O.O.Q.* (often known as *The Mona Lisa with mustaches*), a photo of Mona Lisa with mustaches on her *enigmatic* face.

## My (weekly) obsession

[As I have mentioned before](https://github.com/lorossi/bauhaus-time), I life my life one obsession at the time.

The most recent one is *googly eyes*. They are so funny, they make everything stupid and ridicule. Due to my childish sense of humor, I cannot stop laughing when I stick one to something.

I bought a 700-pack of them and I always keep them in my pockets, ready to be stuck somewhere in hope to make someone else laugh.

I hear you asking *why are you telling me this?*
